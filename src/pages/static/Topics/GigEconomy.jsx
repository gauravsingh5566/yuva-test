        <h3>GIG ECONOMY</h3>
        <p>
          The gig economy has grown significantly as today's workforce becomes more mobile. According to research, 15 million people are working in
          India's gig economy in sectors including professional services and shared services. Over 200 million people are now regarded as being a
          member of the gig workforce globally due to the growth of technology-enabled gig labor platforms. In comparison to regular employment
          situations, it also highlights how much more youngsters, students, and women are involved in gig work. Everything pertaining to the gig
          economy will be explained in this article.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "gig" is frequently used for a variety of activities, from part-time employment to "contract" labor and on-demand staffing
          services, despite its widespread popularity and usage. Instead of using full-time, permanent employees, a gig economy focuses on independent
          contractors and freelancers. Gig labor has been available in India for a while, but it has recently gained popularity as platform-based
          businesses dealing with shared mobility, food-tech, eCommerce, and logistics have emerged. Currently, medium-skilled occupations make up
          approximately 47% of gig labor, high-skilled jobs make up about 22%, and low-skilled jobs make up about 31%. These numbers unequivocally
          demonstrate the significance of the gig economy in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investing in our community's comfort and safety is an investment in a more modern and prosperous future. The gig economy is more prevalent
          in developing nations than in developed ones (5–12%), according to research studies by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and the majority of
          these jobs are in lower-paying job categories like delivery, ridesharing, microtasks, care, and wellness. According to these estimates, 7.7
          million (77 lakh) workers participated in the gig economy in 2020–21.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2029–2030, there will be 2.35 crore (23.5 million) workers in the gig economy. These results highlight the enormous potential and
          dependability of gig work to increase lower-income employees' prospects for a living while fostering a more diverse workforce. Indian gig
          workers have an average monthly income of Rs 18,000 and are 27 years old on average. About 71% of individuals are the only providers for
          their families. Additionally, the average home size of gig workers is 4.4, and 60% of them labor to support their families, carrying heavy
          dependency. While their basic expenses are primarily split between rent (30%), household (68%), education (20%), and healthcare (24%), there
          is little to no room for savings. It should go without saying that such an uneven income can collapse at the first sign of unforeseen
          problems. Therefore, it is essential that gig workers have access to the appropriate financial instruments and services in order for their
          average income to increase to a level that is sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to industry forecasts, there will be more than 200 million combined users by 2029 amongst digital gig workers, blue-collar
          workers, and formal temps. Even while the gig economy has certain obvious advantages, such as ease, flexibility, better unit pay, and higher
          efficiency, measures are also being taken to comply with minimum wage laws, worker protection standards, and consumer rights. To establish
          equity with other forms of labour, governments around the world are attempting to regulate job requirements and social protection. As a
          result, financial products created especially for platform workers are improving access to institutional credit. Following these measures,
          platform enterprises in the pre-revenue and early-revenue stages should be encouraged to apply for grants, loans, and venture capital
          funding from banks and other funding organisations
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventy-nine percent of gig workers want to gain useful skills through gig employment, and two-thirds of them have no post-secondary
          education. Job security and consistent compensation are two other concerns. To meet these expectations, FinTech and platform companies may
          be used to lend to employees on the basis of cash flow rather than collateral, meeting their demands as credit-inexperienced borrowers. To
          advance this goal, unsecured loans to first-time borrowers using platforms could potentially be categorised as Priority Sector Lending. The
          availability of formal credit for women and people with disabilities (PwDs) may also be emphasised, and it may be made available to platform
          enterprises established in India's small cities, towns, and villages. Because comprehensive verification makes it difficult for gig workers
          to access the formal banking sector, numerous fintech businesses have begun to target this market and offer alternatives. This culture has
          generally been driven by sectors like shared mobility, staffing, food delivery, etc. in India. Numerous minor players in the game are
          currently setting their sights high after them. While applying for a loan might be nearly hard for someone without a regular source of
          income, fintech solutions are paving the way for gig workers to reclaim their financial independence. There has been some formalisation in
          this industry with the rise of app-based models for jobs like delivery and home services. We anticipate a rapid growth of this market in the
          upcoming years. By 2027, 50% of all workers worldwide would participate in the gig and freelancing economies in some way, according to a
          Morgan Stanley estimate.

          The country's leading private sector employer, Quess Corp, a well-known provider of business services, recently stated that it has signed
          official contracts to purchase a 49% share in Taskmo, a start-up in the gig economy, for Rs 10 crore

          With this investment, Quess becomes the first organized staffing company to participate in India's digital gig economy. The addition of
          Taskmo expands Quess' current HR service offering, making it the first platform in India to offer qualified personnel in permanent,

        <p>
          The gig economy in India is reaching a turning point. The gig economy and the competitive landscape have undergone a significant
          transformation as a result of the speedy growth of quick commerce, instant delivery, the growth of food delivery over the past year in
          India, and the entry of new players like Zepto into the grocery delivery industry. Along with the risk that Zepto, Dunzo, and other
          companies would steal their delivery staff, companies like Zomato and Swiggy are also compelled to implement new internal regulations due to
          the widespread outcry over the lack of job security and consistent income. Zomato and Swiggy have both pulled back from some verticals due
          to competitiveness in light of this crisis.In a sense, the labor circumstances that gig economy companies have established are now hurting
          them. For instance, it is simpler for these part-time workers to switch to platforms that pay them more because job security and financial
          stability are not distinguishing features of the gig economy in India. For its 10-minute food delivery service, which was already criticized
          for putting unnecessary strain on the delivery staff, Zomato is also having trouble finding delivery personnel. In addition, Zepto, Swiggy's
          Instamart, Tata-owned BigBasket, and other competitors who have stepped in headfirst are making it difficult for Zomato, which has stated
          its plan to purchase Blinkit, which is also in the competitive area, to keep up.

        <p>
          One of the top companies in the nation for managing a varied on-demand workforce of Giggers is GigIndia. Their partners frequently express
          amazement at how well we manage such a diversified staff while carrying out large-scale activities. Their goal of building a community of
          aspiring gig workers who want a flexible profession yet don't want to give up on their aspirations may be one possible explanation for this.
          They treat all of our giggers as a single entity for the benefit of the gig economy, regardless of their backgrounds, and they work to the
          best of their abilities to provide them with the caliber of professional experience they merit. GigIndia greatly contributes to the gig
          economy by ensuring inclusivity in every area, despite the fact that it may seem difficult to manage such a sizable and varied pool of
          Giggers and encourage them to perform at their best. A secure community for people who want to achieve their goals without giving in to a
          conventional method of working has been created because of the great potential in people's combined viewpoints and talents.

          The Fairwork Project has awarded Dunzo and BigBasket a high rating for fair pay in India's gig economy. Uber and Ola, a taxi aggregator, and
          Foodpanda, the latter's food delivery division, received the lowest ratings out of all the businesses on the list. The rankings, which are
          only for Bangalore and only contain 12 Indian online businesses, were made public in association with the International Institute of
          Information Technology, Bengaluru. According to the Fairwork Project, an effort run by Oxford University researchers, among other well-known
          Indian firms in the online gig economy, Flipkart, which is sponsored by Walmart, offers the best working conditions and local minimum
          salaries.
