              Read through these sample guidelines carefully to understand how to post as a YMG20 participant, what tags to use and how to honour your

            <p>
              If you are posting about any event, activity or programme in association with Yuvamanthan, it would be better to post messages that are
              relevant, simple, and interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically, the idea is to attract users’ attention and even engagement is possible, so your post must highlight the best bits of the
              event and key takeaways of the topics discussed on which users can comment, and respond to.
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple tip would be to use short phrases, terms and describing words to publish your thoughts. Take your time to edit or reflect on
              the content and you can take help from our team as well when in doubt, but the end result must showcase your intellect and smartness in
              delivering the content.

            <p>Under the LiFE initiative, the focus shall be to transition from this so-called throw-away society to a more circular economy.</p>
            <p>
              It is very important to differentiate from which account you are posting on the social media channel because if you’re mixing the
              content posting on both channels, you might end up sharing the right message from the wrong account.
            </p>
            <p>
              A tip here would be to share your personal judgements and thoughts through your personal social handles and meaningful ideas and learned
              insights through your professional account to keep things smooth.

            <p>
              At Yuvamanthan, we have created relevant hashtags and keywords for our different social media platforms. Utilising hashtags as part of
              content posting is a good way to save character counts on social media.
            </p>
            <p>Take a look at the following hashtags that you can use to post on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>

            <ul className="list-group border-none bg-gray mt-3">
              <li className="list-group-item border-0 bg-gray ps-0">

              <li className="list-group-item border-0 bg-gray ps-0">

              <li className="list-group-item border-0 bg-gray ps-0">

                </span>
              </li>

            </ul>

            <p>Apart from this, as a YMG20 participant/member don’t forget to tag our official social media handles that are listed as follows.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a>@yuvamanthan_org (Instagram, Twitter, Youtube)</a>

            <h4 className="fs-4 mt-3">Guideline IV – Posting Responsibly with Correct Language Usage</h4>
            <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
              Note that communication online is a different ballgame altogether, so it is vital you post the content responsibly with right facts,
              correct tone and absolutely correct language without any filler/slang words.
            </p>
            <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
              A tip would be to use affirmative tone and explanatory way of posting about activities, events or programmes, but keep in mind the
              character count for the respective social handle you are using to post. For instance, Twitter has a character limit of 140 and new
              allowances for retweeting, tagging photos, and direct replies that don’t count against the character count.
            </p>
            <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
              Similarly, on Instagram, you can use up to 10 hashtags to maximize discoverability. Facebook has very generous character limits, but
              once over approximately 450 characters, your message will be truncated with a “see more” option.
            </p>
            <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
              Avoid using language that is coarse, harsh, and colloquial that harms/hurts any religious, caste, political sentiments at all costs.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-danger">
              Be careful not to disrespect any country’s flag. This may invite action against whoever engages in such an activity.

              <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
                There are numerous narratives that travel across social media without proper descriptions and responses to back them up. So, be polite
                in your approach and try to share comments, replies and links of Yuvamanthan’s activities, initiatives and more in an optimistic tone.
              </p>
              <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
                A tip here would be to use your best judgment while retweeting, resharing, and commenting on your posts and also ensure that the links
                are properly working and appropriate for the shared party/individual.

              <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
                It goes without saying that cyber safety is the most important step while maintaining your online image. Be mindful of all the privacy
                settings, issues, copyright acts, and safety protocols of respective social media forums to avoid any technical/legal hindrance while
                sharing your thoughts online.
              </p>
              <p className="text-dark mb-2 fs-5">
                A vital tip here is to avoid sharing any private information like passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses, etc. with any user
                online and try to interact with the followers in a safe and secure cyber atmosphere.

                  For posting on social media, the participants must take permission and proper formats from their summit convenors. Once they get the
                  green light, they must have their posts/comments/ replies cross-checked and publish only after the convenor sanctions.

              <h4>Social Media Ideas</h4>
              <p>
                Yuvamanthan Model G20 celebrates the ‘Oneness of the world’ therefore posting on social media should highlight this fact. Since YMG20
                is an exercise to develop consensus building among the students, there shouldnt be any element of negativity while addressing any
                student, teachers, country or team as a result of the activity.
              </p>
            </ul>
            <h4 className="m-2 text-primary">For Facebook and Instagram</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {' '}
                If you are posting a selfie with your ‘French’ delegation or individually dressed in your traditional attire or carrying props that
                represent the french culture, you can caption that selfie such as “Bonjour from the French delegation, we are here from Paris for
                Peace and Prosperity.”
              </li>
              <li>Don’t forget to add hashtags under your posts as they are important for more post engagement and user traffic. </li>
              <li>
                {' '}
                Video lengths should be a maximum of 1-2 minutes with desired message/ key points highlighted within. Try to be more polite,
                confident, and sequential while delivering your video or audio content.{' '}
              </li>
              <li> Always keep in mind the word/character count before writing your posts to avoid getting the words truncated. </li>
              <li>Keep your posts simple, short, smart and semi-casual in tone to have more comments, reactions, and replies.</li>
              <li>Always proofread before publishing to avoid errors and mistakes.</li>
              <li>
                Make it a habit of resharing your posts/links on stories, status and as individual DMs whenever possible to attract more viewers
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 className="m-2 text-primary">For Twitter</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>As you know Twitter has an absolute character length, so try to be direct, simple while publishing your posts on the forum.</li>
              <li>
                As the 280-character count does not include poll tweets, videos, or audio, so frame your content in a way that covers your desired
                output rightfully. A tip would be to post within 120-130 character count.{' '}
              </li>
              <li>
                {' '}
                Short hashtags are always better. Ideally, your hashtags should be under 11 characters -- shorter if you can. So, try to have 1-2
                YMG20-related tags only under your tweets.{' '}
