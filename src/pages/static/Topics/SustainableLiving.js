          <p>
            India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people, is currently facing multiple environmental challenges that are threatening the country's
            sustainable development. From air pollution to water scarcity, India needs to transition to sustainable living practices in order to
            secure its future. Sustainable living is about meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future
            generations to meet their own needs. In this essay, we will discuss the challenges India faces and how it can transition to sustainable
            living.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest environmental challenges India faces is air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 14 out of the
            world's 15 most polluted cities are in India. This is mainly due to the use of fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and vehicular
            pollution. The government has taken measures such as introducing the odd-even rule for vehicles and installing air purifiers in public
            places, but more needs to be done. The transition to sustainable living can be facilitated by shifting to renewable sources of energy such
            as solar and wind power, and reducing the use of fossil fuels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge is the management of waste. India generates more than 62 million tonnes of solid waste every year, and a significant
            portion of it ends up in landfills, causing soil and water pollution. The government has initiated several measures such as Swachh Bharat
            Abhiyan and Waste-to-Energy plants to address this issue. However, individuals need to also take responsibility for their waste management
            by reducing, reusing, and recycling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water scarcity is also a pressing issue in India. With more than half of India facing water stress, it is important to reduce water
            consumption and adopt sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment. This can help conserve water resources
            and ensure its availability for future generations. Agriculture is a major contributor to India's economy, but it also poses a significant
            threat to the environment. The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has led to soil degradation and water pollution. Farmers can
            transition to sustainable practices such as organic farming, crop rotation, and use of natural fertilizers to protect the environment and
            reduce health risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transition to sustainable living requires a collective effort from individuals, the government, and businesses. The government needs
            to provide incentives and subsidies for the adoption of sustainable practices, while businesses can play a role in reducing their carbon
            footprint and promoting sustainable products. Individuals can make changes to their lifestyle such as reducing their consumption of meat,
            using public transport, and using eco-friendly products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, India needs to transition to sustainable living practices to ensure a healthy and prosperous future. It requires a collective
            effort from all stakeholders to address the environmental challenges and promote sustainable living. By adopting sustainable practices in
            energy, waste management, water conservation, and agriculture, India can ensure its sustainable development and contribute to global
            efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sustainable living practices are essential for ensuring a healthier and more environmentally friendly future. These practices aim to
            reduce the impact of human activities on the environment, conserve natural resources, and promote social and economic well-being. Here are
            some prospective sustainable living practices that can be adopted to achieve a more sustainable future:

                security.

          <h4>Indian Initiatives Of Sustainable Development:</h4>
          <p>
            India of today is bold and ambitious, sharing the same values as the Global North. It is a country that strives arduously to realise its
            lofty aspirations. This book is a celebration of the India that has come a long way in the last 75 years and strives to achieve even more.
            It is also a homage to the millennial India, which is preparing to meet and conquer its problems and is aware of its priorities for the
            next 25 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government's initiative to honour and remember 75 years of India's independence as well as the illustrious past of its people,
            cultures, and accomplishments is called Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. Yet, it is also a celebration of the aspirational and ambitious India of
            the present and the future. This compilation addresses the 10 policies that would form a sustainable India in this context. Prime Minister
            Narendra Modi used the phrase Amrit Kaal to outline India's development trajectory over the following 25 years during the 2021
            Independence Day celebration. The accomplishment of our goals during this Critical time will enable us to celebrate India's 100th
            anniversary of independence with pride, he said. The goal of this compilation, Amrit Mahotsav: 10 Policies Shaping a Sustainable India, is
            to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Indian independence (the Amrit Mahotsav) and pay homage to the India that will face the next 25
            years of development with the necessary policies in place to address persistent problems and create a more sustainable future for the
            nation and its citizens. Through a number of significant policy actions over the past few years, the country's developmental governance
            has undergone adjustments. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are now viewed as the cornerstone of governance at all levels
            and not only global development governance, essentially include these initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Millennium Development Goals, which were later superseded by the SDGs' more inclusive agenda in 2015, were one of numerous agreements,
            scientific reports, and international declarations that aimed to encourage a more holistic approach to development. The Sustainable
            Development Goals (SDGs) find a theoretical foundation in economist Mohan Munasinghe's "sustainomics" that is framed by a
            transdisciplinary knowledge base while proposing a significantly broadened and comprehensive agenda for developmental governance through
            17 targets. The three normative aims of equality, efficiency, and sustainability are addressed by this construct, which blends economic,
            social, and environmental objectives. These goals frequently show themselves to be incompatible. India's historical development trajectory
            has not been consistent with this idea. But this way of thinking is evolving. During the pandemic-induced lockdown, the government made an
            effort to assist vulnerable populations with social security, but despite its best efforts, significant portions of the population were
            left behind. This is a result of a persistent institutional issue, with the distributional component arising from the population's
            connection to the unregistered informal sector and the magnitude of the migrant labour force that is still unidentified in official
            records. It is clear that market forces are what have so far given the poor and vulnerable people social safety nets. The lockdown
            amounted to a locking down of organic market forces, placing the unorganised labour force in a precarious position. Thus, the SDGs pose a
            governance challenge to India's development policy apparatus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Significant policy changes have been made in the development sector over the past eight years, particularly to increase the nation's
            physical and people capital. The route to achieving the SDGs has been impacted by the epidemic, which served as a jolt to the world's
            economic and development areas. There is no question that the SDGs will make it possible for India to realize its goal of US$5 trillion
            and US$10 trillion in growth.
