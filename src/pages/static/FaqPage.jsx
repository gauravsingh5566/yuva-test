    q: ' What If Total Participants Are Not In Multiples Of 20? A Few Extra Students Want To Participate And We Already Have 40 Students.',
    a: "We suggest that participants should be in multiples of 20 as there are 20 member countries in G20. However, there may be a situation where a few extra students may want to participate in that case you can add guest countries during 'Plan Your YMG20'. It adds a number of new delegates as per the designations selected. So for example, if you selected 2 designations, adding 1 new guest country will add 2 new students as participants. If you added 3 guest countries then 2x3 = 6 new participants can be added.",
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    q: "Why Can't I Choose A Theme For The Leaders Track?",
    a: "Leaders Track is not a Discussion Track, it is a track that decides the agenda. In its meeting, students are chosen as Heads of States participate in a debate to choose the best sub-theme for the rest of the tracks. Therefore, they discuss why certain sub-theme is more important than the other. Other track members (Sherpa, Finance and Foreign) sit as audiences in this track's main meeting, called the Agenda Meeting.",

However, you cannot select just the Leaders Track and organise a summit as it is not a discussion track.',

    id: 13,
    q: 'I have over 200 students wanting to participate, what should I do?',
    a: 'If you add all 9 guest countries and organise all 4 tracks with all designations you can have 140 + 63 i.e 203 participants, thats the maximum capacity. Make sure you have enough space to sit 203 students in Declaration Meetings in a rectangular format facing each other. Also, a good working microphone is critical in such a situation!',
  },

    id: 14,
    q: 'I have only 20 students who have registered, the maximum Participation I can ensure in a week is 40 students. Will it be Enough?',
    a: ' Although we encourage schools to have as many participants as long as they are below the maximum capacity of 203. We know sometimes students are busy. You can organise YMG20 with just 20 students. Select any one of the Discussion Tracks like Sherpa Track and select one designation i.e Sherpa and you will have an amazing YM20 with just 20 students. In case you  manage to reach your target of 40 students add Sous-sherpa in the designation and 40 students can participate.',

    id: 15,
    q: ' We want to keep leaders track and sherpa track but we have only 40 students participating.',
    a: "Of course, you can, however for the sake of having more ideas we don't recommend it. See, essentially members of Leaders Track only discuss which sub-themes have to be picked up for other tracks which lacks generation of new ideas. But we know students want to become Head of States too, if that is important choose Leaders Track and Sherpa Track and do not select Sous-Sherpa in Designation while planning your summit.",

    id: 16,
    q: ' Can teacher coordinators be judges as well?',
    a: 'The Jury in the YMG20 is another vital group that would determine the results and top achievers for the day. The jury for the event will have four key members: two faculty, one journalist, one eminent social personality and one civil servant or a political leader or a Y20 representative (if available). So yes, Teacher Coordinators can be a part of the Jury.',

    q: '  I am a teacher coordinator and i am not able to activate the Discussion board. Software not working!',
    a: "Only one selected Teacher Coordinator can manage the discussion board. We hope you are the one! However, in the worst-case scenario where the software has a glitch we don't want your preparation to go in vain. You can organise the meetings without depending on the Discussion Board. In such cases resolution points can be recorded on paper. Voting can be done by raising of hands and a communique can be drafted on  paper as well. You will have to email the final communique on modelg20@yuvamanthan.org",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    q: ' We sent out the joining link invites to students and many have Shown interest in participating. What to do next?',
    a: 'We hope all of them have completed the G20 Orientation module. if not, ask all of them to complete it, it will give them a certificate too. Now for next steps, the Teacher coordinator will organise meetings with the eager  participants and explain the summit format and what is expected of them. They will also orient them on what G20 forum is. Once this. is done, they can be added as delegates. Once added as delegates, go to Plan Your YMG20 and depending upon their numbers you may design your summit',

  {
    id: 19,
    q: ' How do we plan venues, is there anything specific needed?',
    a: 'Venues are crucial for YMG20. A bad venue can spoil the fun of debating. Make sure each Discussion Track gets. a separate room/hall and there is a hall that can sit all participants in a rectangular or circular format, facing each other preferably with a desk in from of each. If you feel there is a space or infrastructure constraint you may cut down on the number of participants. The venues should also be comfortable, and equipped with a microphone so that students can hear and discuss with each other.',
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    q: '  What should participating students carry with them on the Event day?',
    a: 'If you are using YM Discussion Board, the students should be allowed mobile phones, laptops or tablets with them to the venues. Else pen and paper will work too!',
