          'Years of unusually low interest rates and lax lending requirements drove a house price bubble in the US and internationally laid the groundwork for the financial catastrophe. In the beginning it was all set out with good intentions. In response to the dot-com bubble crash, numerous corporate accounting scandals, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Reserve decreased the fund rate, as low as 1%, in an effort to stimulate the economy by making money readily vailable to companies and consumers at low rates.',
          'As a result of borrowers taking advantage of the low mortgage rates, housing values began to  rise rapidly. It was possible for people with bad credit or no credit history to fulfill their dream of owning a property. Homeownership eventually reached its saturation point as interest rates began to increase. The Federal Funds Rate reached 5.25% two years after the Fed began hiking rates in June 2004, and it stayed there until August 2007.',
          "In early 2006, the prices of the homes and estate began to fall. For many Americans, this created quite some difficulty. Now their homes were worth less than what they paid for. They owed money to their lenders, and consequently they were unable to sell their homes. If they had adjustable-rate mortgages, their expenses increased as the value of their properties decreased. The most vulnerable subprime borrowers were forced to stay in mortgages that they couldn't actually afford.",
          'One subprime lender after another declared bankruptcy as 2007 got under way. It became clear that the subprime crisis could not be resolved by the financial markets and that its effects extended well beyond American territory. The U.S. economy had entered a full-fledged recession by the winter of 2008, and as financial institutions struggled to maintain liquidity, stock markets globally were seeing their steepest decline since the September 11 terrorist attacks.',
          'By the summer of 2008, the carnage was spreading across the financial sector. The historic bankruptcy of the renowned Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers in September was the biggest in American history, and it served as a symbol of the devastation brought on by the global financial crisis for many.',

          'The most common definition of globalisation follows that the world is getting excessively interlinked, and networks of interdependence are more intense than ever. This also means that what happens in one part of the world can affect the other regions irrespective of spatial and cultural dissimilarities. It is an age where the successes and failures of a nation are not contained within the national boundaries. This stands true for India as well, where the path it takes over the next few years is closely watched by the world and will also determine the trajectory of global development.',
          'As a country which accounts for one-sixth of the world’s population and has a huge demographic dividend, India has always held a significant global position. Due to its unique geographical location in South Asia, its colonial history, active participation in international forums and its alliance-building characteristic, India is also seen as a more lucrative partner in global economic growth and influential in shaping global trends. In India, 183 million more people between the ages of 15 and 64 are expected to be added to the labour force between 2020 and 2050. Further, it is expected that by 2027, India’s working-age population will grow to be 18.6% of the global labour force. Making this population pool a fully equipped resource in terms of education, skills, and health would also generate a vital source of labour for the rest of the world. It is widely acknowledged that India and the rest of the world stand to gain significantly from maximising the potential of this resource. Additionally, the labour force would unlock the potential consumer demand for industries to meet. According to the World Economic Forum, the middle class will comprise the largest proportion of the population in India by 2030 and is predicted to account for 75% of consumer expenditure in 2030, up from roughly 50% presently. Around 80% of households will have middle incomes by that time. This would further lead to exponential demand, increasing India’s consumption costs and making it profitable.',
          'The middle class is predicted to account for 75% of consumer spending in 2030. Around 80% of households will have middle incomes by that time, up from roughly 50% currently. This market would have exponential demand, which would increase India’s consumption costs and make it profitable. If India is successful in utilising its demographic dividend, a more educated and better-employed youth population will support the consumption increase from this expanding middle-class group with the addition of almost 140 million additional families. Globally, industries will have the chance to serve this market better and utilise the population’s youth and skills.',
          'India has the sixth-largest economy after the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. According to IMF estimates, India contributes roughly 15% of global growth despite facing significant obstacles like poverty, unequal resource distribution, and inadequate healthcare and education. In addition, from 2000 to 2020, India’s contribution to the global GDP at current prices (PPP) rose from 4% to 6.8%. This compels one to consider the likelihood of global growth once India achieves a more equitable distribution of prosperity among its various classes, communities, and regions. India’s actual potential will be unleashed, and the country will be able to contribute to global prosperity in a much more significant way if the obstacles that stand in its way are overcome.',
          'By obtaining USD 83.57 billion in FDI, India set a record for annual FDI inflow and demonstrated its rapid rise as a top investment destination. FDI inflows have increased 20 times during the past 20 years. Ongoing efforts are to improve India’s status as a secure and desirable investment location. FDI inflows boost production, make it easier for investors to transfer knowledge, and as a result, provide India with a competitive edge in a variety of industries. ',
          'Due to its crucial contribution to the global supply of vaccinations during the COVID-19 crisis, the nation’s standing in the world was further strengthened. In total, 98 nations received more than 235 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from India. India’s potential to share the benefits of its domestic scientific research system would be further improved by improving the manufacturing and scientific research ecosystem. Going beyond national interests demonstrates a global solidarity ethos. The country has become a key participant in the Asian bloc and an important participant in the changing geopolitical landscape of a multipolar world. Furthermore, India’s decision to address its sustainability goals and issues related to economic growth can provide an example for many other developing countries in a similar position, especially regarding climate change. ',
          'India’s approach will certainly have an impact on the rest of the world in the following decades. Long-term economic success for India rests on its ability to create a clear national value proposition that identifies the opportunities and features of its business environment. Numerous non-economic elements also affect a country’s ability to influence the global economy. It is essential to consider India’s success beyond only its strength on the economic front. India’s capacity to make social progress, produce in a sustainable manner, and distribute assets and value more fairly must all be considered while defining success in India. By including all of the previously described factors, the competitiveness framework redefines what success means for India. ',

          'As the world is becoming more urban than ever, it is crucial to place cities at the centre of the development agenda to try to enhance their liveability and mobility. At the same time, it is vital to place economic growth and sustainability parallel to each other. Focussing on sustainability is particularly important for addressing the environmental challenges facing cities that have become routine features — air and water pollution, traffic jams, congestion and waterlogging. In this context, conversations on urban design encourage targeted deliberations that seek to scale up approaches to making cities smart and sustainable and helping them mature into places of socio-economic opportunities for its expanding labour force. A better quality of life, a safer and more secure environment, and a greater ability to function as an urban entity are just a few of the vital benefits of effective urban planning methods. Inclusive urban design generates results that holistically make for better-built environments and, in turn, a way of living, regardless of the size of a city planning project. Additionally, it gives each city a distinct sense of identity and creates the foundation for greater adaptability to changing climatic, economic, or social factors.',
          'In this setting, the idea of a “smart city” combines information and communication technology (ICT) with numerous physical devices linked to an Internet of Things (IoT) network in order to connect with inhabitants and improve the effectiveness of local operations and services. City municipalities may engage directly with both community and city infrastructure, thanks to smart city technology, which also enables them to keep an eye on what is occurring in the city and how it is changing. ICT is utilised to improve the quality of urban services, their effectiveness, and interactivity, as well as to cut costs and resource usage and improve citizen-government interaction. Frameworks for smart cities are created to control urban traffic and enable quick responses. The concept of a smart city depends upon gathering data and information that is further used to improve the processes, operations and governance systems of the city. Furthermore, this data is leveraged for managing resources, assets and services effectively and efficiently. A smart city is driven by information systems and aids the monitoring and managing of utilities like power plants, water supply networks and garbage disposal to services like schools and hospitals.',
          'Additionally, the spread and support of discourse on sustainability have also significantly influenced how our cities are planned and developed, in addition to this development. Today, the idea of a smart city is seen as a vision, manifesto, or promise that seeks to define the ideal and sustainable city design for the 21stcentury. A smart city is thus a productive, technologically advanced, environmentally friendly, and socially inclusive metropolis. In other words, smart city applications put a specific technical focus in the foreground of developing solutions for ecological, sociological, economic, and management concerns. In India, the concept of smart cities (under the aegis of the Smart Cities Mission) is based on six fundamental principles – putting the community at the core of planning and implementation, optimal use of resources in a way that generates more outcomes using lesser resources, cooperative and competitive federalism, adopting innovative methods for sustainable solutions, using technology as a means to achieving goals and financial convergence.',
          'Currently, 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in cities, and that percentage is predicted to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 due to urbanisation, which will result in the addition of 2.5 billion more people to cities over the course of the next three decades. In order to keep up with this rapid expansion— which is straining the resources of our cities — environmental, social, and economic sustainability is essential. According to the World Bank, smart cities make the process of urbanisation more inclusive through the integration of migrants and the impoverished into the city; bringing together the formal and informal sectors; connecting the urban centres and peripheries; and providing services for both the rich and the poor. These smart and digital cities with embedded networks of surveillance also offer protection and security through an enhanced criminal investigation mechanism.',
          'Rethinking cities to make them more liveable, inclusive, and integrated is a key component in promoting smart cities. Smart cities need to build fair, participatory, sustainable, inclusive, and all-encompassing urban development policies and planning in order to achieve these feasible goals. Moreover, to better plan for expansion and handle day-to-day operational issues, we must provide our cities with dynamic mechanisms. This, therefore, facilitates proper strategic planning, development, and management activities that serve as a coherent vision for the future of urban ecosystems in our smart cities. In order to improve the quality of life and lessen the environmental impact of urbanisation, a sustainable smart city with environmental, social, economic, and cultural dimensions must be established. This city must also integrate the newest technology with governance and enhance innovative socio-technical, socio-economic, and sociocultural aspects of growth.',

          "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how the interconnectedness of countries may have made the world more vulnerable to common threats, and has exposed weaknesses in international cooperation. Major challenges are not limited by jurisdictional borders, and demand collective action. This necessitates investigating cutting-edge methods of international cooperation. However, efforts by the government to innovate are typically restricted to local or national boundaries. Why doesn't cross-border cooperation happen more frequently? And how might this paradigm be altered?",
          'Government organizations are frequently designed to concentrate on specific subject areas. However, complicated issues or those that fall under the purview of several jurisdictions necessitate reevaluating current governance structures and methods. Governments are establishing new governance organizations to handle cross-border problems in order to address this. Although they differ in formality, legal mandate, scope, and architecture, they all share the same goal: to coordinate and amplify the activity of parties that are geographically separated. It has been observed that governments are engaging with innovative governance bodies at transnational levels to tackle global issues, as well as at intra-national levels to ensure coherence domestically.',
          "For instance, a Nordic organization for cross-border cooperation made up of delegates from Finland and Sweden's local governments. Its goal is to increase the Kvarken region's worldwide competitiveness, internal connection, and allure for foreign tourists and investors by utilising the potential of cross-border collaboration to foster growth and innovation. The Council seeks to incorporate even the smallest municipalities in its programmes in order to promote inclusive and environmentally sound economic growth. This goal is driven by the conviction that collaboration based on trust among all regional players may produce excellent outcomes.",
          'Top-down or center-out governance organizations can lead cross-border government innovation, but peer-to-peer relationships can also develop through horizontal networks. In fact, the complexity of cross-border regions might make formal institutions too complicated or the obstacles to direct institutional partnerships might be too high, boosting the value of other types of regular collaboration. As a way to create innovation capacities across borders and systems and as a method of promoting cultural capacities that strengthen cross-border collaboration, networks are becoming increasingly inventive in their form and function.',
          'For instance, Open European Dialogue (OED) is an informal association that brings together European parliamentarians from various political perspectives to talk about shared problems and concerns. The OED offers a cutting-edge forum for cross-border discourse that aims to be varied, informal, and apolitical, with a focus on human-centered process design and open dialogue. Politicians from various levels of government, parties, and nations can engage in a variety of discussions, test their thoughts, form personal bonds, and encounter a variety of viewpoints.',
          "Currently, governing bodies are typically top-down organizations. To increase their horizontal capacity, networks work. Nevertheless, think of each of their separate components traditionally. More holistic approaches are being pioneered by emerging dynamics of governance systems, many of which reimagine the nature and roles of significant participants and create new connective tissue and mechanisms to innovate jointly. Co-designing, co-funding, and co-governance of international ventures are some examples of such strategies. The Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is an innovative governance structure that approaches partnerships, funding, planning, and delivery with intention, systematisation, and collaboration. The Borderland regions along England and Scotland in the United Kingdom represent a transformational potential to produce long-term sustainable prosperity for people, places, and companies. A combined investment package totaling GBP 450 million (EUR 520 million) has been gathered for cross-border initiatives aimed at enhancing the region's physical spaces and skill sets.",
          'Regulatory effectiveness, economic and administrative efficiency, risk management across borders, improving knowledge flow, and achieving economies of scale are some of the major advantages of cross-border collaboration. In order to handle key challenges and carry out global missions, governance bodies define common visions and objectives for innovation initiatives and coordinate components. Networks link people together to share knowledge and innovation techniques across borders and to help participant inputs make sense. Co-funding and co-governance are two examples of innovative systems dynamics that serve as the connective tissue for ongoing alignment.',
          'Additional layers of coordination, the difficulty of jurisdictions deviating from norms, perceived loss of sovereignty, a complete understanding of the costs/benefits of cross-border collaboration, competing political interests, and developing a sense of equity in the distribution of the costs and benefits are the main obstacles to cross-border collaboration. Challenges specific to innovation projects also include:',
          '● recognising the effects and advantages of international efforts.',
          '● acquiring financing.',
          '● navigating administrative restrictions and various structures.',

          '● differences in work styles and culture',
          "Success examples are supported by a number of success criteria. Focusing on sectors that entail global 'goods' and global risks, as well as challenges where there is a strong incentive for cooperation, all contribute enormously in fostering broad cross-border collaboration. Likewise, setting specific goals. Determining shared missions, strategies, and objectives is also essential. A co-funded secretariat's ability to carry out tasks is also very valuable. Finally, trust is a crucial component of success.",
          'Securing political and leadership support and lobbying from the highest levels of government is crucial. This is essential for establishing priority status, influencing decision-making, boosting confidence, developing momentum, winning funding, and making sure that the creative structures and support systems required for long-lasting initiatives are in place.',
          'Cross-border initiatives should only be pursued when they make sense and engage all stakeholders in developing a clear vision and plan for collaboration. Cross-border initiatives should only be pursued when a problem can be solved more effectively as a group than as an individual and when there are incentives to work together currently in place or that may be created. Following the identification of these areas, all parties should come to consensus on a vision and strategy that has specific goals.',
          "The costs and advantages of collaboration should be shared, and it's crucial to be conscious that they might not all materialize immediately. Cross-border government innovation initiatives should incorporate reciprocity from all parties, with the knowledge that the latter may take some time to manifest and may not be uniformly distributed. When weighed against the costs of not collaborating, the objective should be a net benefit for all partners.",
          'Fostering enduring relationships throughout time will help you become a trustworthy spouse. Cross-border government innovation calls for developing a shared understanding, delegating authority and making decisions jointly, being open and honest about goals and expectations, and being prepared to accept and cooperate with the systems and procedures of other partners. Governments should spend effort developing long-lasting connections.',
          'The development of channels for original concepts and solutions, such as through democratic decision-making procedures and collective intelligence, has long been supported by the fields of public sector innovation and allied fields like open government. Similar to businesses, governments are increasingly adopting experimentation as a major mode of innovation. Governments may test ideas in ways that encourage learning and help keep risk levels manageable thanks to the ideas and solutions that result from these efforts. These ideas and solutions enable the government to go beyond organization-centric thinking. Governments and their partners are now using comparable strategies in cross-border and even international contexts as a result of the success of these efforts within nations and jurisdictions.',
          'For instance, the Global Innovation Collaborative is a network and platform for cooperation through which municipal administrations from all over the world organize open innovation contests and encourage zealous inventors to implement solutions in regional testbeds. Its objective is to use challenge-based concepts and collective intelligence to surface ideas and encourage shared learning in order to build more resilient and sustainable cities while also hastening the economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.',
          "The issues facing modern societies are becoming more complicated and interwoven, which has increased interest in evidence-based policy making among governments and other stakeholders. This has in turn prompted policymakers in many governments to emphasise experimental methods more. Small-scale experiments can help innovation become more real and certain while also increasing learning and feedback opportunities and lowering the costs of failure. Three primary levels connected to novel methods in cross-border testing and experimentation have been discovered by OPSI and the MBRCGI's work in order to assist make sense of this newly emerging topic: Building a strategic layer for cross-border experimentation, cross-border testing and experimentation in the actual world, and new places and processes for cross-border testing and experimentation. For instance, 5G-MOBIX is a global partnership for testing driverless vehicles. In order to test connected and automated vehicles equipped with 5G across European borders and encourage their widespread deployment, a cooperative, multinational network of partners from many industries will work together. The project involves eight local urban testing locations in China, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea in addition to two testing 'corridors' between Portugal and Spain, one between Greece and Turkey, and two between Portugal and Spain and Portugal.",
          "Benefit-wise, these kinds of initiatives can assist governments in better understanding relevant cross-border ecosystem participants and supplying channels for grassroots participation, particularly with the general public. Additionally, they can support a culture of active listening and learning, advance flexible and agile government processes, reduce risk, and guarantee that policies and services better meet the needs of stakeholders, citizens, and residents. They can also help to ensure that all voices are heard and taken into account. The ability of governments and their partners to carry out ground-up activities and to experiment with novel strategies across borders is, however, constrained by a number of obstacles. For instance, cultural opposition to such activities could force participants to follow predetermined, linear paths that aren't always enough to handle complicated, international problems. Lack of feedback and learning loops while testing new concepts leads to effort duplication and overlap, which is another significant problem. Finding ways to scale up successful small tests into larger, more fully realized efforts is a common difficulty for experimentation in particular.",
          "While these issues serve as the main obstacles for international bottom-up and experimentation programmes, certain success factors have also been identified. Ability and willingness to create locations and processes where fundamental ideas can emerge (such as cross-border citizens' assemblies, conduits for collective intelligence, and sandboxes) constitute functional factors. Actively talking about progress and involving all pertinent parties are also significant factors. Time spent outlining ecosystems and locating pertinent stakeholders is a fundamental part of these efforts. Establishing roles to work across borders to forge relationships among key actors is also a crucial aspect of collaborative success",

India has provided over 235 million total supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to 98 nations worldwide under the vaccine 'Maitri' initiative. A focus on government capital expenditure, especially in building world-class infrastructure, has been a hallmark of the recovery process. The Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative, a significant diplomatic effort to provide made-in-India vaccines to low-income and developing countries worldwide, was started by India in January 2021. Among the nations that benefited from the Vaccine Maitri programme were Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Morocco, South Africa, Afghanistan, Mexico, DR Congo, Nigeria, United Kingdom, and many others. Only four days after launching its own vaccination campaign, India began sending the vaccines abroad on January 20, 2021.

However, NRIs are required to have NRE or NRO accounts with Indian banks. The most recent development occurred when Worldline, a European payments facilitator, and the National Payments Corporation of India International Payments Ltd (NIPL) partnered to enable payments over UPI. As part of this collaboration, Worldline's QR code-based solution will let Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems at businesses in Europe accept UPI payments from Indian customers using their mobile devices. Later, Indians will also be able to use their RuPay debit and credit cards to make purchases in Europe. Prior to this, NIPL had a contract with Singapore's Liquid Group to allow UPI QR-based payments in ten nations (spread across North and Southeast Asia). In the ten markets of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, Liquid Group integrates a vast network of merchant purchasing partners.",

Following its test-firing in 2001, BrahMos was initially commissioned into the Indian Navy in 2005. The Indian Army and Indian Air Force later adopted the missile, with the latter integrating it with its Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter aircraft of Russian descent. It appears that the BrahMos is an improvement over the Russian P-800 Oniks cruise missile. The range of the PJ-10's basic model is projected to be between 300 and 500 km, with the export model's range being regulated at 290 km in accordance with the MTCR. The Brahmos is a launch vehicle that can be used to launch conventional or nuclear payloads from the sea, the air, or the ground. According to a US $368 million agreement between Manila and New Delhi in January 2022, the Philippines became the first export market for the BrahMos missile. Although a formal purchase has not yet taken place, Vietnam has thought about getting the missile system to protect itself from Chinese incursions into its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. The missile system has drawn interest from Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand as well.",
