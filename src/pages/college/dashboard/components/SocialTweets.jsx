      'Yuvamanthan Model G20 Summit is a truly mesmerizing experience. I am not an intellectual type of person and usually shy away from participating in such activities. But now I feel I was wrong, this platform has changed my mindset and I believe that the youth must engage in activities like YMG20 not just for the sake of experience but for finding your inner leader. Thank you Yuvamanthan for helping me find my strengths through this awesome activity. Hope it happens more often in our school.',

The students were knowledgeable and the debate was engaging, and all this provided a good foundation for understanding global economic issues. The discussion forums were a valuable tool for connecting with other learners and sharing ideas.
