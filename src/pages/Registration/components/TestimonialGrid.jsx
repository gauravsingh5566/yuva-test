      'Yuvamanthan Model G20 Summit is a truly mesmerizing experience. I am not an intellectual type of person and usually shy away from participating in such activities. But now I feel I was wrong, this platform has changed my mindset and I believe that the youth must engage in activities like YMG20 not just for the sake of experience but for finding your inner leader. Thank you Yuvamanthan for helping me find my strengths through this awesome activity. Hope it happens more often in our school.',

      "For the first time ever I participated in a debate cum discussion and realized that you don't need any specific skillset to be a participant apart from advanced general knowledge. My constant surfing of social media came in handy and I was able to contribute to the event through my ideas which were appreciated by one and all.",

I enjoyed voting for and against resolutions and my points were chosen to be included in the communique. The discussion forums were a great way to connect with other learners and learn from their experiences. Overall, I would definitely recommend YMG20 to every educational institution in India.',
